Analyses were conducted in R Studio version 4.0.2.  

Data used were from the Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study (https://gladstudy.org.uk/)

The analysis script includes the following components:

1. Data preparation and descriptive statistics for the GLAD sample

2. Factor analyses
  
  a) Exploratory factor analyses: 1-6 factors run for 15 and 16 item model. 
  
  b) Confirmatory factor analyses: confirmation of 4 factor model in entire data set. 

3. Regression analyses with age and sex:
  
  a) Logistic regression analyses for individual symptoms (symptom_binary ~ age/10 + sex + PHQ.total.score + GAD.total.score)
  
  b) Linear regression analyses for factor scores (factor ~ age/10 + sex + PHQ.total.score + GAD.total.score)
